// Bun 1.4.0 injects its `expect` into every module it transpiles under `bun test`, including
// @aztec/foundation's field module, which then calls `expect.addEqualityTesters` (a Jest/Vitest API
// Bun lacks) and throws at import. A warm transpiler cache hides this locally; CI is always cold.
// Mirror the module's own fallback so the testers land where it would have put them.
