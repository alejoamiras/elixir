// H5 — a send-ahead that never settles: V6 is pinned with its automatic settlement off, its miner
// and a mined balance settled by hand as the baseline, then a send-ahead sits in a checkpoint no
// proof ever covers. With V6's node stopped and the rig's cheat codes owning the clock, V7 takes
// over, the proof window passes, V6's rollup prunes: its Outbox has no root for that epoch, a
// forward reverts as such, and its pending tip is back at the baseline. Only then V6 runs again,
// and the holder's balance is back where it was, because the burn was in a block that never
// happened — the one truthful UX claim for an unsettled crossing.
