// a passkey key in the default mode stores only metadata (the master is re-derived from the PRF on
// every open); a passkey key that "stays open on this device" stores the master, and a words key
// its phrase's entropy (so the words can be shown again), sealed with AES-GCM under a
// non-extractable device key kept in the same database. Every open, in every mode, re-derives
// account 0 and fails closed unless it equals the stored address — under the build's account class,
// or, for a record made under the class before it, under that one, once (see classes.ts).
